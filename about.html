                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm Phillip Kulikov, a 18-year-old senior from Evansville Day School with a passion for technology. I am fascinated by the endless possibilities that technology offers. This curiosity led me to dream of a career in Computer Science and, more recently, to being a part of the Nextech Catapult program. In this program, I'm fortunate to be able to refine my technical skills and learn about the intersection of technology and business. UE is my top choice for pursuing my degree and I am excited to dive deeper into this field, and making meaningful contributions to technology and open source projects.</p>

                <h2>Academics</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Advanced Placement courses in Calculus AB, Biology, Macroeconomics, Microeconomics, English Language and Composition, Seminar, and Spanish III DC</li>
                    <li>SAT: TBD</li>
                    <li>ACT: TBD</li>
                    <li>Class of 2024</li>
                    <li>Participating in National Honor Society and the Sociedad Honoraria Hisp√°nica</li>
                    <li>Being a member of the school's varsity soccer team since my Sophomore year</li>
                    <li>This year, I am challenging myself further by enrolling in AP Calculus BC and AP Computer Science A</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Music</h2>
                <p>Outside of academics and technology, music has a special place in my life. For the past five years, I've been playing both the guitar and the flute. I find that music provides a unique sense of joy and satisfaction. The focus and rhythm required in music, I believe, parallel the logic and creativity needed in coding. I am also a huge fan of Rap and Hip Hop - <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/phizlip">last.fm/user/phizlip</a>. Enjoying music will give me qualities that I know will be useful for my career in Computer Science.</p>

                <h2>Volunteering</h2>
                <p>Outside of school, I believe in the importance of giving back to the community. Over the last two years, I have volunteered at my church. One significant mission was preparing food for the Grace of Christ Church mission in Ukraine, a fundraiser aimed at supporting families affected by the ongoing conflict. These experiences have taught me the power of community and the impact that even one person can make.</p>
